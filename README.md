# HandsOn Repository - Data Visualization Course

This repository is related to the **Data Visualization** course taught by Dr. Willington Pavan.

## Project Overview:
This group project was developed by **Younghoo Cho**, **Rakesh Singh**, and **Fatemeh Maghsood**. It utilizes **R version 4.3.1** for data analysis and visualization.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to review how to use Git and GitHub while working with RStudio through simple example scripts. Using the sample file `dataset.csv`, we practice data analysis and visualization in R. The project also focuses on enhancing group collaboration by utilizing Git and GitHub for interoperability and workflow management.

## Brief descriptions of each EDA task:
The project analyzes the file `Dataset.csv` with the following objectives:
- Perform summary statistics for key variables in the dataset.
- Analyze data distribution and detect outliers.
- Investigate the correlation between climate variables and crop yield.
- Explore time series trends in the data.

You will find 4 different types of R scripts in the repository, each covering a specific analysis aspect.

## How to Run the Code:
There are 4 different R scripts in this project:
- `summary_stats.R`
- `data_distribution.R`
- `correlation_analysis.R`
- `time_series_analysis.R`

To run the code:
1. Download the repository and open it in RStudio by creating a new project.
2. Run each script individually.

The result graphs from each script will be stored in the local `plots` folder.

## Instructions for Collaborators on How to Contribute:
- **Younghoo Cho**: Host of the repository, developed all 4 scripts, and stored outputs.
- **Rakesh Singh**: Updated the repository, contributed to building all 4 scripts, and stored outputs.
- **Fatemeh Maghsood**: Updated the repository and developed the initial `summary_stats.R` script.
